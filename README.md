        ```json
        {
          "ConnectionStrings": {
            "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE;Database=workouttracker_dev;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
          },
          "Jwt": {
            "Key": "YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY_MINIMUM_32_CHARS",
            "Issuer": "https://localhost:XXXX", // Check your launchSettings.json
            "Audience": "https://localhost:XXXX" // Check your launchSettings.json
          }
        }
        ```
3.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    Open a terminal in the `backend` folder and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update --project DataAccess -s Back_WorkoutTracket
    ```
4.  **(Optional) Seed Initial Data:**
    If you want to populate the database with exercise types and workout templates:
    ```bash
    dotnet run --project Back_WorkoutTracket seeddata
    ```
5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run --project Back_WorkoutTracket
